Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.\nSpark it is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.  \n[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a company founded by the creators of Apache Spark, that aims to help clients with cloud-based big data processing using Spark."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Traditional analysis tools like R and Python Pandas run on a single machine but data are growing faster than computation speed.  \nThe Opportunity: **Cloud computing** is a game-changer.  \nIt provides access to low-cost computing and storage.  \nDistributing data over cluster of machines means lots of hard drives, lots of CPUs but also lots of memory !  \nStorage is getting cheaper but stalling CPU speeds are the bottlenecks.  \nA new Opportunity:  Keep more data **in-memory**!\nIn-memory can make a big difference, up to 100x faster.\nSpark is a new distributed execution engine that leverages the in-memory paradigm.\n\nThe challenge with cloud computing has always been programming the resources.  \nSpark is developed in Scala and - besides Scala itself - supports other languages such as Java and Python.\nWe are using for this example the Python programming interface to Spark (pySpark).\npySpark provides an easy-to-use programming abstraction and parallel runtime: “Here’s an operation, run it on all of the data”."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Spark Context\n\nIn Spark, communication occurs between a driver and executors.  The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the executors for completion.

The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver.\nWhere does code run?  \n- Locally, in the driver\n- Distributed at the executors (Executors run in parallel and have much more memory)\n- Both at the driver and the executors\n\n\nProblems with cheap hardware are: failures, network speeds versus shared memory, much more latency, network slower than storage, uneven performance.  \nHow do we deal with machine failures? We launch another task.  \nHow do we deal with slow tasks? We launch another task.\n\nWhen running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext).  \nSparkContext tells Spark how and where to access a cluster.   \nThe program next creates a [SQLContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext) object which is used to create and manage the DataFrames.  \nWhen the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications.  \nWhen using Databricks, both a `SparkContext` and a `SQLContext` are created for you automatically. `sc` is your `SparkContext`, and `sqlContext` is your `SQLContext`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Display the type of the Spark sqlContext\ntype(sqlContext)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Note that the type is `HiveContext`.
